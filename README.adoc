* The Reactive Manifesto

** _Responsive_ Able to handle requests in a timely fashion
** _Resilient_ Able to manage failure gracefully
** _Elastic_ Able to scale up and down according to the load and resources
** _Message Driven_ Using asynchronous message-based communication among the components forming the system, async messages ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency
